zone-clean
==========

After experimenting with several systems, I've found a fairly effective way
to split chores among myself and my two roommates.

We divide the apartment into three zones: kitchen, bathroom, and everything else.

Each week one of us is responsible for cleaning a zone, and the zone
assignments rotate. All cleaning must be completed between Sunday and Tuesday at midnight,
or else the failing roommate must throw $50 into a collective kitty. If the kitty reaches $150, we hire
a cleaning service to clean the whole apartment.

So far, this repo just contains a script that creates the rotating zone assignments. I hope someday I will get bored and extend it to:

* Automatically send reminder emails
* Maintain some sort of tracking of failures and kitty size
* Become sentient and take over the apartment.

To use the script, just stick in your roommates names and adjust the
number of zones to match your # of roommates. Copy-paste the output
of the script to an email, and enjoy endless cleanliness.
